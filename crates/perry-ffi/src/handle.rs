//! Handle registry — opaque integer IDs for Rust objects that
//! survive across the FFI boundary (added in v0.5.x of the
//! perry-ffi v0.5 surface — non-breaking; pure additions).
//!
//! Most non-trivial wrappers (mysql2 connection pools, ws clients,
//! ioredis pipelines, even simple ones like lru-cache) need to
//! hand a long-lived Rust object to TypeScript and get it back
//! later. We can't pass Rust ownership directly across `extern "C"`
//! — the runtime can't drop a `Box<MyType>` because it doesn't know
//! `MyType`'s vtable. Instead we register the object in a global
//! [`DashMap`], return a small integer handle to TypeScript, and
//! every method call comes back through the FFI with the handle
//! plus a type-aware downcast.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Single process-wide [`DashMap`] keyed by [`Handle`] (a `i64`).
//! Each `i64` is allocated atomically from a counter starting at 1
//! — `0` is reserved as `INVALID_HANDLE` so `register_handle` can
//! never produce a falsy value (matches JS truthiness semantics
//! for type checks like `if (handle)`).
//!
//! perry-stdlib has its own copy of this same registry (in
//! `crates/perry-stdlib/src/common/handle.rs`). They are separate
//! integer spaces — perry-ffi-allocated handles cannot be looked
//! up via perry-stdlib's `get_handle`, and vice versa. Programs
//! that link both registries (e.g. via the well-known flip) just
//! end up with two `DashMap` statics; each wrapper consults the
//! registry it was compiled against, so handles never collide.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! [`get_handle`] / [`get_handle_mut`] return `'static` references
//! by exploiting the fact that DashMap entries are stable while
//! they exist. The caller must not drop the handle (via
//! [`take_handle`] / [`drop_handle`]) while a borrow is live.
//! Single-threaded FFI usage — the typical pattern — has no
//! aliasing problem; multi-threaded wrappers should use
//! [`with_handle`] which scopes the borrow under a closure.
